# php-study

Simple Repository that helps me better understand coding funcdamentals in PHP/Vanilla. E.g Inheritence, Polymorphism etc.

# inheritence

this directory demonstrates a simple inheritence of for example, formOne class from the Student class.


# import-class

this directory contains a mini-project that basically stores Student information using Mysql.
the class in classes/d-base/mysql.php handles mysql queries.
this class is imported by respective files, for example index.php, which has the UI for student registration.

    # header.php

        contains header tags and initial imports.

    # footer.php

        contains footer tags and footer imports.
